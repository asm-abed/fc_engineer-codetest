From the conducted data exploration here are my findings:

Pricing Table
- 2 seemingly identical products are shown (Samsung TV both priced at 599) with different PUK which may suggest they are different products but with lack of justification would otherwise be treated as the same product

Transactions Table
- transaction fields are incomplete and does not include puk which in the long term would be problematic
- users in the transactions table also has more users than what the users table has
- there are missing and incorrect values in the table (trans_id: 1036, 1044)
